# GoldFTP
Modify GoldRaccoon FTP for large file upload &amp; download issue 

I use goldRaccon as ftp library in my current project. However, I found there are some memory issues 
when I download or uploard large files (> 1GB). I modified some parts of GoldRaccoon to fix this issues.
Currently, it works well in my project.
